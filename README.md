Project descriptionIn recent years, the study of analytics has grown to encompass virtually every field and industry. In simple terms, analytics pertain to the logical analysis of data or past trends to predict future outcomes and gain actionable insights to make strategic business decisions. To be the most effective statistician or researcher one must start with data mining. Data mining is the practice of examining a set of data to discover patterns or relationships in the data that otherwise were unseen. The goal of our study aims to use data mining techniques such as regression and classification using a statistical software package, R, to analyze a dataset pertaining to psychometric testing of veterans to find strong patterns and relationships as well as clean the data for errors through input.
